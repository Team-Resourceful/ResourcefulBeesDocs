## **Creating a Bee**
***

With the base mod alone you get 18 bees but you can add as many bees as you want and modify the existing bees.

* First locate the `resourcefulbees` config folder inside the main config folder.
* Inside this folder you'll see a sub folder labeled `bees`.
* If you have run the game at least once, you'll see 18 .json files named according to each bee added by the mod inside the `bees` folder. 
* Create a .json file inside this folder for each bee you wish to add to the game. So for example: `Blaze.json` if you want to add a blaze bee.
* After you've created a .json file with the name of the bee you wish to add, you can use the [bee template](https://resourceful-bees.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.3/data_templates/bee_template/) to custom design your new bee.
* On the left you will find pages which break down each Bee Data object and explain what is necessary and what isn't.
* For every custom bee, entries will need to be add to a [language file](https://resourceful-bees.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.3/getting_started/language_files/) so the names of the bee and associated items/blocks display correctly in-game.
